# Sustenance

Calorie-counting diet planner and tracker

## Synopsis

### Count calories

In `sustenance.toml`:

```toml
# pantry
[[food]]
name = 'rolled-oats'
serving-size = '100g'
protein = 13.2
carbs = 67.7
fat = 6.5

# meals
[[meal]]
date = 2018-05-31
time = 10:15:00

  # eat 150g rolled oats
  [[meal.portion]]
  food = 'rolled-oats'
  servings = 1.5
```

**cli**:

```sh
export RAKULIB=lib
bin/sustenance --date=2018-05-31 gen-macros sustenance.toml
```

**raku**:

```raku
use Sustenance;
my Date $date .= new('2018-05-31');
Sustenance.new(:file<sustenance.toml>).gen-macros($date);
```

### Make a diet plan

Make a diet plan for a lightly active male athlete, age 31, weighing 59
kg at 175.26 cm.

**cli**:

```sh
export RAKULIB=lib
bin/sustenance \
  --weight=59.4206 \
  --height=175.26 \
  --age=31 \
  --gender=male \
  --activity-level=lightly-active \
  gen-diet-plan
```

**raku**:

```raku
use Sustenance::DietPlan;
Sustenance::DietPlan.new(
    :weight(59),
    :height(175.26),
    :age(31),
    :gender<male>,
    :activity-level<lightly-active>
).gist;
```

## Description

### Calorie tracking

Processes daily caloric intake from [TOML][TOML] meal
journal formatted per the [synopsis](#synopsis) (see also:
[doc/sample-pantry.toml](doc/sample-pantry.toml)).

The Sustenance meal journal must consist of at least one *food* entry
and at least one *meal* entry.

Each *food* entry must have:

key            | description                               | value
---            | ---                                       | ---
`name`         | name of food                              | string
`serving-size` | serving size                              | string
`protein`      | grams of protein per serving              | number
`carbs`        | grams of total carbohydrates¹ per serving | number
`fat`          | grams of fat per serving                  | number

Each *food* entry may have:

key       | description                                                         | value
---       | ---                                                                 | ---
`aka`     | alternative name by which food is known                             | string
`aka`     | alternative names by which food is known                            | array of strings
`fiber`   | grams of total fiber² per serving                                   | number
`fiber`   | grams of total fiber per serving, `$insoluble-fiber / $total-fiber` | array of floats or array of integers
`alcohol` | grams of alcohol per serving                                        | number
`source`  | source of macronutrient data                                        | string

Each *meal* entry must have:

key       | description  | value
---       | ---          | ---
`date`    | `yyyy-mm-dd` | date
`time`    | `hh:mm:ss`   | time
`portion` | see below    | array of hashes

Each meal *portion* must have:

key        | description                | value
---        | ---                        | ---
`food`     | name of food               | string
`servings` | number of servings of food | number

¹: [total carbohydrates][total carbohydrates] includes all types
of carbohydrates - sugars, sugar alcohols, starches and dietary
fiber - per USA food labels (see: [international food labeling
differences][international food labeling differences])

²: *total fiber* includes both soluble and insoluble fiber

### Diet planning

Creates rudimentary diet plan for weight maintenance, muscle gains and
fat loss.

First estimates Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) with the Mifflin St Jeor
equation.

Then estimates Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) by taking the
product of BMR and the appropriate Katch-McArdle multiplier for a given
activity level.

Adds 250-500 calories on top of TDEE to estimate caloric intake
requirements for muscle gains.

Subtracts 250-500 calories from TDEE to estimate caloric intake
requirements for fat loss.

Recommends obtaining 1.4-1.6 grams of protein per kilogram body weight.

Recommends obtaining 20-35% of daily calories from healthy sources of fat.

Recommends obtaining remainder of daily calories from healthy sources
of carbohydrates.
